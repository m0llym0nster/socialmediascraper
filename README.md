I am using the no starch book - "Dive into Data Science" to create a simple web scraper.
I am hoping it will help me with some of my sponsorhip job with roller derby.
Ideally I will use the scraper to tell me how many times we mention a specific list of sponsors in a month between our social media feeds.
I'm sure something already exists but I need to build this myself to get a better understanding of web scaping in general.

Please re-use for your roller derby team if it makes sense!

Instructions to follow once code is working! (:
